# Logfile Analyzer
This is a python program to analyze logfiles generated by IPL's CVD machine. The objective is to easily compare pressure v.s. time behaviour of the CVD machine over multiple runs, 
to ensure consistency (and help identify potential causes of differences between samples) and detect deterioration or damage early.
Currently, the logfiles are in the form of hard-to-parse CSV files; comparing different runs requires one to compare csv files in e.g. Excel, which is difficult to do.

Sample logfiles can be found in `csv-samples/`
